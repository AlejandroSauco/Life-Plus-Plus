## NFC library for Arduino

This is an Arduino library for PN532 to use NFC technology.
It is for [NFC Shield](http://goo.gl/Cac2OH) and [Grove - NFC](http://goo.gl/L3Uw5G).

### Features
+ Support I2C, SPI and HSU of PN532
+ Read/write Mifare Classic Card
+ Works with [Don's NDEF Library](http://goo.gl/jDjsXl)
+ Communicate with android 4.0+([Lists of devices supported](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/PN532/wiki/List-of-devices-supported))
+ Support [mbed platform](http://goo.gl/kGPovZ)
+ Card emulation (NFC Type 4 tag)

### To Do
+ To support more than one INFO PDU of P2P communication
+ To read/write NFC Type 4 tag

### Getting Started
+ Easy way

  1. Download [zip file](http://goo.gl/F6beRM) and extract the 4 folders(PN532, PN532_SPI, PN532_I2C and PN532_HSU) into Arduino's libraries.
  2. Download [Don's NDEF library](http://goo.gl/ewxeAe)ï¼Œ extract it into Arduino's libraries and rename it to NDEF.
  3. Follow the examples of the two libraries.

+ Git way for Linux/Mac (recommended)

  1. Get PN532 library and NDEF library

          cd {Arduino}\libraries  
          git clone --recursive https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/PN532.git NFC
          ln -s NFC/PN532 ./
          ln -s NFC/PN532_SPI ./
          ln -s NFC/PN532_I2C ./
          ln -s NFC/PN532_HSU ./
          ln -s NFC/NDEF ./

  2. Follow the examples of the two libraries

### Contribution
It's based on [Adafruit_NFCShield_I2C](http://goo.gl/pk3FdB). 
[Seeed Studio](http://goo.gl/zh1iQh) rewrite the library to make it easy to support different interfaces and platforms. 
@Don writes the [NDEF library](http://goo.gl/jDjsXl) to make it more easy to use. 
@JiapengLi adds HSU interface.
@awieser adds card emulation function.
